Description
___________

Proteus is a decoder and converter for the ancient Greek and Latin
texts of the TLG and PHI digital libraries.
The TLG/PHI databases can be searched via a user interface (GUI) and
complete texts can be extracted as pdf documents, plain Unicode (utf-8) text
or as \LaTeX\  source code for further processing.
